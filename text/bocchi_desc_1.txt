Originally an investigation in animation, this desktop extension offers an imaginative blend of dino Bocchi and lack of utility. Bocchi is overlayed on screen and click and drag functionalities allow you to interact with her, hopefully enhancing the overall computer using experience while not getting in the way of actual work. Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but everyday computer tasks seem marginally less ordinary.
