Using Puppeteer, a Node.js library that gives “virtual” access to Chrome, I crafted a simple Pixiv art scraper. This web scraper bypasses the entirety of Pixiv’s oauth flow and extracts low-quality screenshots of the artworks in question. But I argue, at first glance, if the artwork looks alright, one might find themselves visiting the original pixiv page anyways. Screenshots are periodically sent to users throughout the day.
